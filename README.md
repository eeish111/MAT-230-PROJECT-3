# MAT-230-PROJECT-3

**Project Summary**
The Grocery Tracker project is a C++ program designed to process a list of grocery items and their frequencies from an input file. The program provides functionality to look up individual item frequencies, display a complete list of items with their counts, visualize item frequencies in a histogram format, and save frequency data to a backup file. This project solves the problem of efficiently analyzing and managing grocery data, which could be used for inventory tracking or sales analysis.

**Accomplishments**
I implemented the program with clear and functional logic, ensuring accurate data handling and output formatting. The program successfully uses file I/O to read and write data and user interface with interactive menu options.

**Opportunities for Improvement**
While the program meets functional requirements, optimization could include:

**Enhanced File Error Handling:** Adding detailed error messages and recovery options.
**Input Validation:** Adding safeguards against invalid user input for smoother user experience.

**Challenges Overcome**
The most challenging aspect was ensuring the program's file I/O operations worked seamlessly across various environments. Debugging issues like undefined references and incorrect file paths required consulting documentation and using a structured debugging approach. Additionally, resources like the C++ standard library documentation and online programming communities were invaluable.

**Transferable Skills**
From this project, I gained:

**File I/O Handling:** Skills for reading from and writing to files.
**Data Structures:** Practical use of maps for data organization.
**Problem-Solving: **Debugging complex issues.
